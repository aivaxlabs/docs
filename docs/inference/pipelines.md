# AI Pipelines

AI Gateway pipelines are the processing steps AIVAX applies before and during inference. They can add context, rewrite queries, expose tools, moderate input, route models, truncate conversations, and call external workers.

Most pipelines are configured in the gateway parameters. Request-level options can override some inference parameters on direct `chat/completions` calls.

## RAG

RAG links [collections](/docs/rag/collections) to an AI Gateway. The gateway controls:

- Collections included in retrieval.
- Maximum number of retrieved documents.
- Minimum score.
- Reranker name.
- Whether chunk references are included.
- Query strategy.

When a gateway has knowledge collections and the latest user message contains text, AIVAX can retrieve matching documents before the model call. For injection strategies, the retrieved context is inserted at the beginning of the last user message. If a linked collection has its own context text, that collection context is added to system instructions.

Query strategies:

- `Plain`: Uses the latest user message as the search query.
- `Concatenate`: Joins the latest configured number of user messages line by line and searches with the combined text.
- `UserRewrite`: Rewrites recent user messages into one or more search queries using a resolver model.
- `FullRewrite`: Rewrites recent user and assistant messages into one or more search queries using a resolver model.
- `QueryFunction`: Adds a query function to the model. The model decides when to search the linked collections, and search results are returned as tool responses.

Rewrite strategies add resolver-model cost and latency. They are useful when users ask follow-up questions such as "what about this case?" because the resolver can turn the recent conversation into a clearer search query.

Defining many RAG results increases input token usage and can increase final inference cost. Start with a small result count and raise it only when the model lacks enough evidence.

## Instructions

Instruction settings shape the provider-facing prompt:

- **System instructions**: Added to the system instruction set.
- **Remote system instruction sources**: Fetched from configured URLs and added to the system instruction set.
- **User prompt template**: Replaces `{prompt}` with each user message's text before sending it to the model.
- **Assistant prefill**: Adds initial assistant content before generation when the model supports prefill.

Remote instruction sources are fetched as text with a 10 MB maximum response size. Their cache duration is configurable; the default is 600 seconds.

Some models do not support assistant prefill, temperature, stop sequences, or reasoning effort. Integrated model validation rejects incompatible gateway settings when those limitations are known.

## Skills

Skills are on-demand instruction packs available to the model. When a gateway enables skills, AIVAX loads the account skills configured on the gateway and can expose skill-related built-in functions.

Read more about [skills](/docs/features/skills).

## Multimodal pre-processing

Multimodal pre-processing converts selected media content into text before the main model call. The available flags are `Image`, `Audio`, `Video`, `File`, `OtherFiles`, and `All`.

Use pre-processing when the main model is text-first or when you want AIVAX to normalize media into textual context. For direct multimodal models, send the original media without pre-processing so the model can inspect it directly.

Media descriptions are cached by content hash for reuse.

## Parameterization

The parameterization pipeline configures model request options such as:

- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `presence_penalty`
- `frequency_penalty`
- `stop`
- `max_completion_tokens`
- `reasoning_effort`
- `verbosity`
- `seed`

Request-level values can override gateway values when the endpoint supports the parameter. Some integrated models reject specific parameters, and BYOK providers may have their own restrictions.

## Context truncation

The context truncation pipeline uses an approximate token count. When `ContextMaximumSize` is set and the conversation exceeds the limit, the gateway follows `ContextOverflowAction`:

- `Throw`: Return an error instead of calling the model.
- `Truncate`: Remove older non-system messages until the conversation fits.

Truncation preserves system messages and keeps at least one user message when possible. If the remaining user message still exceeds the limit, the request fails with a message-size error.

On the free plan, the effective input context is capped at 65,536 tokens even when a larger context is configured.

## Tool message truncation

`ToolContextCount` controls how many recent tool response messages keep their original content. When it is set to a value greater than zero, older tool messages remain in the conversation but their content is replaced with:

```text
[tool response truncated - call this tool again]
```

This can reduce context usage in long agentic conversations. It can also hurt chains where an old tool result remains important, so use it only when the model can safely call the tool again.

## Server-side tools

Server-side tools are internal functions executed by AIVAX during inference. They can come from:

- Built-in tools.
- Protocol functions.
- Remote protocol function sources.
- MCP sources.
- QueryFunction RAG.
- Skills.
- Optional bash environment.

Server-side tool events can be streamed to clients as `servertool` updates.

## Built-in tools

Built-in tools can be configured on a gateway or supplied per request with `builtin_tools`. Available built-in tool flags include:

- `WebSearch`
- `AdvancedWebUsage`
- `OpenUrl`
- `Code`
- `Request`
- `Calendar`
- `Remember`
- `GenerateWebPage`
- `GenerateDocument`
- `XPostsSearch`
- `ImageGeneration`

See [Built-in tools](/docs/tools/builtin-tools).

## MCP and protocol functions

Tools listed by an MCP source become available to the model with their declared schemas. MCP tool results can include text, images, and audio; media results are attached to the conversation as additional messages when supported.

Protocol functions expose HTTP callbacks or AIVAX callback URLs as model-callable tools. Remote protocol function sources are fetched and cached before their tools become available to the model.

See [Protocol functions](/docs/tools/protocol-functions) and [MCP](/docs/tools/mcp).

## Function interpreter

A tool handler can add tool-calling behavior for models that do not reliably produce native tool calls. Supported values are:

- `native` or `null`: Use native model tool calling.
- `react.v1.selfcall`: Use the ReAct-style self-call handler.

If a handler name is not recognized, gateway configuration fails at inference time.

## Moderation

Moderation runs a resolver model over the conversation and scores categories for violence, sexually explicit content, political content, dangerous content, and jailbreak attempts. If configured thresholds are exceeded, AIVAX marks the original conversation messages as not forwarded and asks the model to respond that it cannot engage with that content.

Use moderation for broad safety policy. Use workers when the decision depends on external identity, account state, or business-specific policy.

## Workers

Workers are external HTTP hooks called during gateway execution. They can stop an event, let it continue, rewrite message context, add tools, add system instructions, or replace a server-side tool result.
